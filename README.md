# Class Presentation

<h2>This a site that I made for a class presentation about sports ( hockey, basket, boxe and some games ).</h2>
<h3>I have made this site to steal my classmates passwords and that's why the passwords aren't hashed. It was really fun. </h3>

There is 5 pages:

 - Login/Register;
 - Home to present the themes;
 - Ratings page to rate the presentation;
 - The commmentary section;
